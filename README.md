# Nonogram Solver
A deterministic nonogram solver implemented in Python. This solver leverages the intersections of potential solutions to deduce cell values.

# Version 2.0 Updates
Introduced a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using tkinter.
Users can select the board dimensions and subsequently input the hints for both columns and rows.
Upon board creation, the interface checks for board congruence.
In-game functionalities include:
View Full Solution: Displays the entire solution to the puzzle.
Verify User's Solution: Checks the correctness of the user's input against the actual solution.
Reset Board: Clears the current board state, allowing users to start over.
Return to Main Menu: Navigate back to the starting screen.
